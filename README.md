### Questions, Issues, etc:


What is a secret:
Things you don't want to be exposed, database credentials, SSL certificates, etc


What is secret management?
Secret management centralizes sensitive information. There are many different services that provide this like [Crypt](http://xordataexchange.github.io/crypt/), [Conjur](https://developer.conjur.net/), and Configuration Storage Systems like Consul or etcd. 


Why do we need this?
In the past there was one hero who had access to all the passwords. This made it difficult for anyone
else to get access to these applications. But managing passwords, making sure they're all a certain length containing certain special characters, and managing access is a hard challenge. Secret management makes it so you can restrict and grant access when you need to, as well as change passwords without having to tell the whole organization.
